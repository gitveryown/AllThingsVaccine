                        <p>Before AllThingsVaccine.com you could not assure yourselves that somebody walking into your facility is carrying a fraudulent card or a real card, so we go back to the facility that issues the card to be able to provide more information on the cardâ€™s correct format.

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>After completing your vaccination series, yes a vaccination certificate is created in VAMS after a healthcare professional logs a COVID-19 vaccine dose for a recipient in VAMS and these records are stored with the health department. However the businesses you visit do not have access to the health department's database. Ultimately, having your record at the state health department does not convenience you unless you need to replace your original card (which you will not need to do once you have uploaded the card to AllThingsVaccine.com)
